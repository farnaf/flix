### Notes
When doing the collectionView part of this assignment, I initially wanted to program it myself since Tim mentioned that collectionView setup is similar to the tableView that we did in assignment 1. Programming it myself without double checking my work with the recorded lessons was very challenging, but taught me that I need to try new lessons out myself to make sure I can work on future projects without depending on youtube videos.

### Notes
This was an interesting assignment to work on. I really appreciated all the videos and clear instructions on how to make the program work. The assignment was a bit challenging because of all the different settings that needed to be set up for the program to work as expected. Other than the focus and attention to detail it required, I felt good about the difficulty of this assignment!
